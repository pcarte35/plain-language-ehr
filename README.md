# 🩺🥼💉 Medical Plain Language Simplifier

This Python script simplifies complex medical text into plain language using **rule-based logic** and a curated **medical thesaurus**. It is designed to support projects aimed at improving patient understanding and reducing barriers caused by **low health literacy**.

This repository supports a research initiative focused on health literacy improvement by translating dense medical language into accessible terms. While the current version uses Python-based string processing and pattern matching, future expansion includes leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for more dynamic and context-aware simplification.

## 🧠 What the Code Does

The script performs the following:
- Loads a **CDC-inspired thesaurus** of complex-to-plain medical terms
- Applies a series of **language simplification rules** to:
  - Convert medical jargon into everyday language
  - Replace passive voice with active voice
  - Eliminate redundancy and complex phrases
  - Format longer sentences into clearer chunks
- Processes sample sentences and outputs simplified results

## 📚 Dataset / Model Used

### 🔹 Plain Language Thesaurus
The embedded thesaurus (`cdc_thesaurus`) is based on terminology adapted from the **CDC’s Plain Language Thesaurus**, covering a wide range of medical and healthcare-specific terms.

### 🔹 Rule-Based NLP Logic
The script uses custom **regular expressions** and **substitution rules** to support:
- ✅ Grammar refinement  
- ✅ Medical term translation  
- ✅ Jargon removal  
- ✅ Readability improvements  

> This version **does not require a machine learning model or external API**, ensuring fast, offline usage and full transparency.
