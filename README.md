Medical Plain Language Simplifier

This Python script simplifies complex medical text into plain language using rule-based logic and a curated medical thesaurus. It is designed to support projects aimed at improving patient understanding and reducing barriers caused by low health literacy.

This repository supports a research initiative focused on health literacy improvement by translating dense medical language into accessible terms. While the current version uses Python-based string processing and pattern matching, future expansion includes leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for more dynamic and context-aware simplification.

What the Code Does
The script performs the following:

Loads a CDC-inspired thesaurus of complex-to-plain medical terms.

Applies a series of language simplification rules to:

-Convert medical jargon into everyday language.

-Replace passive voice with active voice.

-Eliminate redundancy and complex phrases.

-Format longer sentences into clearer chunks.

Processes sample medical sentences and prints simplified results.
