Plain Language Thesaurus
For Health Communications
This Plain Language Thesaurus has been put together by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention’s National Center for Health Marketing. Our aim is to help make health
information clear and easy to understand.
This thesaurus offers plain language equivalents to medical terms, phrases, and references
that we often use. The technical terms found in health information can be confusing. This
thesaurus is a tool to help you find words that people may understand better.
While the plain language choices given here may not have the specific nuances of
meaning that technical terms have, they offer the possibility for better understanding by
your audience. With plain language equivalents, it is more important to be understood
than to be medically precise.
Precise medical terminology is vital when communicating to those with a technical
background. But the public often stumbles over such terms and misunderstands their
meaning. This is especially a concern for people who do not speak English as their first
language and those without strong reading skills. Reaching your audience–on their
terms–is the main goal of plain language.
This is a living document. It is intended to be refined and to grow as more health
communicators and experts add words, topics, health conditions, and synonyms. We have
started the process of building this tool by defining the scope, format, and broad
categories of terms to be included. Excellent existing resources and glossaries from CDC,
HHS, and universities were reviewed for terms and subject areas. Key sources included

Clear Language and Design (CLAD) thesaurus

Harvard’s three Plain Language Glossaries (one for asthma, lupus, and arthritis).

The foundation for the terms in this initial edition was formed when preparing
information for the public health threats of an influenza pandemic. We have also included
other categories of disease and health conditions to provide a tool that can be referenced
to make any health topic more easily understandable.
We invite you to suggest additional terms, plain language synonyms, and topics to be
added in future editions. For more information, please contact Sarah Gregory at CDC by
email at sgg7@CDC.GOV.
